# Military Threat Detection System using YOLO & Streamlit

This project aims to revolutionize surveillance and threat detection in modern military environments by integrating state-of-the-art object detection using the **YOLO algorithm** and a user-friendly **Streamlit interface**. The system enhances situational awareness and safety in conflict zones by automatically identifying potential threats and classifying entities in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with **YOLOv8**
- Identification of:
  - Friendly and enemy soldiers
  - Weapons (guns, rifles, explosives)
  - Military vehicles (tanks, trucks)
  - Civilians and civilian vehicles
  - Defensive structures (e.g., trenches)
- Streamlit-powered web dashboard for:
  - Image and video uploads
  - Visual feedback with bounding boxes
  - Confidence score display
  - Adjustable detection parameters
